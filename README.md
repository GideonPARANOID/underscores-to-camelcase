Not much to say really

Small Java program which converts function and variable names written_like_this to ones writtenLikeThis.
Possibilities for improvement:
* Recognition of filetypes, understanding the language they're written in checking standard library functions.
* More dynamic approach, recognising functions and variables properly (following "function" or a privacy declaration and searching the document for their names to rename. Could fix aforementioned issue.
